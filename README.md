# Bias-Detection-and-Mitigation-in-AI
This notebook aims to show that machine learning models are exposed to risks like risks of bias, and to introduce some simple techniques to detect and mitigate bias. In this case study, we suppose that we are working for a credit institution. The client wants to automate the loan eligibility process thanks to a binary classification ML model trained on historical data. Regarding the dataset used in this notebook, it comes from a public challenge organized by the company Analytics Vidhya. It contains details about customers details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others as well as the related loan status. Given these customer information, the purpose of the binary classification model is to predict the loan status : yes or no. In this notebook, we are going to apply a logistic regression model as a binary classifier.
